Good question — this is one of those little formatting details screenwriters care deeply about, and it’s easy to get wrong when implementing programmatically.

## 🎬 Standard: Parenthetical Positioning

In screenplay formatting (per **Hollywood standard, e.g., Final Draft, Celtx, Fountain**):

* **Character name**: centered at **4.0" from left margin**
* **Parenthetical**: indented slightly left of dialogue — starts at **3.5" from left margin**, ends around **6.0"**
* **Dialogue**: starts at **2.5" from left margin**, ends around **6.0"**
* Each element has its own vertical spacing.

Here’s how that visually lines up:

```
              KEVIN
          (to self)
     Wow. These groceries are heavy.
```

## 📏 Measured Layout (US Letter)

Typical **Courier 12pt, 1" margins** screenplay layout (55 lines/page):

| Element       | Left Margin | Right Margin | Width | Alignment                   |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----- | --------------------------- |
| Scene Heading | 1.0"        | 1.0"         | 6.5"  | Uppercase                   |
| Action        | 1.0"        | 1.0"         | 6.5"  | Flush left                  |
| Character     | 3.7"–4.0"   | —            | ~1.6" | Centered block              |
| Parenthetical | 3.2"–3.5"   | 2.5"         | ~3.0" | Narrow, centered under name |
| Dialogue      | 2.5"        | 2.5"         | 3.5"  | Indented block              |
| Transition    | —           | 1.0"         | —     | Flush right                 |

## 🧱 How to implement in your TipTap editor

Each element can be styled in CSS (since you’re using `tiptap-extension-pagination`):

```css
.scn-character {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  margin-left: 4in;
  margin-right: auto;
  text-align: left;
}

.scn-parenthetical {
  margin-left: 3.5in;
  margin-right: 2.5in;
  font-style: italic;
  line-height: 12pt;
}

.scn-dialogue {
  margin-left: 2.5in;
  margin-right: 2.5in;
  line-height: 12pt;
}
```

Since your pagination extension supports **mm units**, convert these:

* 1 inch = 25.4 mm
* So:

  * 4.0" → 101.6 mm
  * 3.5" → 88.9 mm
  * 2.5" → 63.5 mm

That means your left margins for parenthetical lines will be **~88.9 mm** and right **~63.5 mm** if you use mm in configuration.

## ✅ Practical TipTap approach

* Each of your screenplay node extensions (`character`, `parenthetical`, `dialogue`) should render as a `<p>` with a `data-type` and `class` (like `.scn-parenthetical`).
* Enforce indentation purely via CSS, not inline styles, so pagination calculations remain consistent.
* Parentheticals belong **between** `character` and `dialogue`. You can enforce that relationship via a small ProseMirror plugin to prevent standalone parentheticals.


---

## 💡 Key takeaway

Parentheticals are **narrower than dialogue** and slightly more indented than character names — visually centered under the name but *not* truly centered text.

They begin at **3.5" from the left** (≈ 88.9 mm) and extend to about **6.0" right margin**, creating that tucked-in look you see in the screenshot.
