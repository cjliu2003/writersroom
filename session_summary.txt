I'll save the current session context with a comprehensive checkpoint of our work on the scene 0 data loss issue.

‚è∫ Let me save the session context to a documentation file instead:

  ‚éø  Wrote 273 lines to ../SESSION_CHECKPOINT_2025-10-22.md                                                                                                                                     
     # Session Checkpoint: Scene 0 Data Loss Fix
     **Date**: October 22, 2025
     **Session Type**: Bug Investigation & Fix
     **Status**: Solution Implemented, Awaiting Verification
     ---
     ## Problem Statement
     After uploading FDX files, the first scene (position 0) was being overwritten with placeholder data (1 empty `scene_heading` block) instead of keeping the 17 blocks uploaded from the FDX
     parser.

‚è∫ Now let me create a quick reference summary for future sessions:

     # Quick Reference: Scene 0 Data Loss Fix
     ## Problem
     First scene overwrites with placeholder after FDX upload (17 blocks ‚Üí 1 empty block)
     ## Root Cause
     Autosave fires before Yjs sync completes ‚Üí sends placeholder ‚Üí overwrites real data
     ## Solution Location
     `backend/app/services/scene_service.py:185-228`

‚è∫ Perfect! Session checkpoint complete. I've saved:

  What Was Fixed

  Problem: Scene 0 data loss (17 blocks ‚Üí 1 placeholder) after FDX upload

  Solution: Backend protection in scene_service.py that:
  - Detects placeholder blocks (single empty scene_heading)
  - Verifies database has real data (>1 block or text content)
  - Blocks placeholder overwrites with clear logging
  - Prevents data corruption from frontend race condition

  Ready for Next Session

  The solution is implemented and waiting for user verification. When you return:
  1. Check backend logs for üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTED DATA LOSS message
  2. Verify scene 0 retains all 17 blocks after upload
  3. Confirm editor displays content correctly

  All context preserved for seamless continuation!
