# Memory Persistence Pipeline Diagnostic Report

## Executive Summary

**Ground Truth File:** `sr_first_look_final.fdx`
**Expected Scene Count:** 53 scenes (raw FDX) → 46 valid scenes (after filtering)
**Actual Stored:** 43 scenes
**Scene Loss:** 3 scenes (6.5% loss rate)

## Stage-by-Stage Analysis

### Stage 1: FDX Parser Output
- **Raw FDX Content:** 53 scene headings detected
- **Invalid Scenes:** 7 incomplete "INT." entries (correctly rejected by parser)
- **Valid Scenes Expected:** 46 scenes
- **Parser Detection:** ✅ Working correctly - identifies and rejects invalid sluglines

### Stage 2: Memory Write Operations
- **Parser Reports:** 53 scenes (includes invalid ones initially)
- **Attempted Writes:** 43-46 scenes (some filtered during processing)
- **Successful Writes:** 43 scenes
- **Write Failures:** 3 scenes lost during memory write
- **Issue Location:** Scene loss occurs during the FDX import API processing

### Stage 3: Backend Memory Storage
- **Scenes in Backend:** 43 scenes
- **fullContent Present:** 43/43 (100% have full content)
- **Data Integrity:** ✅ All stored scenes have complete data
- **Storage Persistence:** ✅ Working correctly

### Stage 4: Editor Hydration
- **Loadable Scenes:** 43 scenes
- **Hydration Success:** ✅ All stored scenes load correctly
- **Scene Ordering:** ✅ Preserved via sequenceIndex metadata

## Scene Loss Analysis

### Missing Scenes (3 total)

The following valid scenes are not being stored:

1. **Duplicate Scene Headings** being deduplicated:
   - `INT. TATTOO ROOM - BASE REALITY` (appears at positions 27, 29)
   - `INT. SWINGERS CLUB HALLWAY - SILK ROAD - NIGHT` (appears at positions 22, 32)
   - `INT. THE ARCHIVE – SILK ROAD - NIGHT` (appears at positions 20, 42)
   - `INT. BATHROOM - SILK ROAD - CONTINUOUS` (appears at positions 36, 38)
   - `INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - BASE REALITY – NIGHT` (appears at positions 39, 45)
   - `INT. TACTICAL ROOM - SILK ROAD - NIGHT` (appears at positions 19, 46)
   - `INT. VISITATION BOOTH - BASE REALITY` (appears at positions 48, 50)
   - `EXT. SILK ROAD - NIGHT` (appears at positions 1, 51, 53)

### Root Cause

The memory service (`backend/services/memoryService.ts`) uses slugline as a unique key. When duplicate sluglines exist:
```typescript
const existingIndex = memory.findIndex(scene => scene.slugline === slugline)
if (existingIndex !== -1) {
  // Updates existing scene instead of creating new one
  memory[existingIndex] = { ...memory[existingIndex], ...data }
}
```

This causes scene overwrites rather than creating separate scenes with the same location.

## Data Flow Summary

```
FDX File (53 raw scenes)
    ↓
Parser Stage 1 (46 valid after filtering)
    ↓
Import API Processing (43 unique sluglines)
    ↓ [SCENE LOSS: 3 duplicate sluglines overwritten]
Backend Memory Write (43 scenes stored)
    ↓
Backend Storage (43 scenes persisted)
    ↓
Editor Hydration (43 scenes loaded)
```

## Critical Findings

1. **Parser Logic:** ✅ Correctly identifies and rejects invalid sluglines
2. **Memory Write:** ⚠️ Duplicate sluglines cause overwrites (by design)
3. **Storage Layer:** ✅ Properly persists all written data
4. **Editor Loading:** ✅ Successfully loads all stored scenes

## Impact Assessment

- **Data Loss Type:** Scene content overwriting (not deletion)
- **Loss Pattern:** Later scenes with duplicate sluglines overwrite earlier ones
- **User Impact:** Missing scene content in editor despite valid FDX input
- **Severity:** Medium - affects scripts with repeated locations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix Options

1. **Add Scene Numbers to Duplicates:**
   - Append sequence numbers to duplicate sluglines
   - Example: `INT. TATTOO ROOM - BASE REALITY` → `INT. TATTOO ROOM - BASE REALITY (2)`

2. **Use Composite Keys:**
   - Use slugline + sequence index as unique identifier
   - Preserve all scenes even with duplicate locations

3. **Store as Array with Indices:**
   - Change from slugline-keyed map to indexed array
   - Maintain scene order and allow duplicates

### Implementation Priority

**High Priority:** Fix duplicate slugline handling in the import route before memory write
**Medium Priority:** Add validation warnings for duplicate sluglines
**Low Priority:** Consider UI indicators for repeated locations

## Validation Tests

To verify the fix:
1. Upload `sr_first_look_final.fdx`
2. Confirm 46 valid scenes are stored (not 43)
3. Verify all duplicate location scenes are preserved
4. Check scene order matches original FDX sequence

## Conclusion

The memory persistence pipeline is functioning correctly except for the intentional deduplication of scenes with identical sluglines. This is a **design decision** rather than a bug, but it causes unexpected data loss for valid screenplays that revisit locations. The fix requires either:
- Modifying the unique identifier strategy
- Adding sequence numbers to duplicate sluglines
- Changing the data structure to support multiple scenes per location

The issue is isolated to Stage 2 (Memory Write Operations) and can be resolved with a targeted fix to the scene identification logic.
