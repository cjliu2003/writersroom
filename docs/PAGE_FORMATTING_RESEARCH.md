## Final Draft: Professional Screenplay Formatting

### Standard Screenplay Margins

**Industry Standard Dimensions**:
- **Top**: 1 inch
- **Bottom**: 1 inch (can vary by ±0.25 inches)
- **Right**: 1 inch (can vary by ±0.25 inches)
- **Left**: 1.5 inches (binding margin)

**Paper Size**: 8.5" x 11" (US Letter)

**Source**: Final Draft automatically formats margins according to screenplay industry standards, removing the need for manual adjustment.

### Page Break Algorithm

**Target**: ~55 lines per page

**Technical Implementation**:
- Line spacing configured to achieve ~6 lines per inch
- With 1-inch margins on 8.5" x 11" paper → ~54-55 lines of text (excluding page number)
- 12pt Courier font with 12pt line spacing yields approximately 58 lines per page
- Alternative: 12.5pt line spacing can also achieve the target

**Smart Page Breaking**:
Final Draft prevents "widows and orphans" - paragraphs that belong together but are incorrectly separated by page breaks.

**Example Scenarios**:
- **Character name at bottom of page**: Automatically moved to top of next page with dialogue
- **Dialogue continuation**: Shows "MORE" indicator when dialogue spans pages
- **Scene heading orphans**: Scene headings kept with their content
- **Sentence breaks**: Optional setting to prevent sentences from breaking across pages

**Configuration Options**:
- Users can enable/disable sentence breaking at page boundaries
- Keyboard shortcuts and page breaking rules configurable in settings
- Element-specific format controls (indents, justification, line spacing)

### Font Specifications

**Standard Screenplay Font**: 12pt Courier or Courier Prime (monospace)
- Fixed-width characters ensure consistent character counting
- Industry standard for script length estimation (1 page ≈ 1 minute screen time)

## Google Docs: Flexible Document Formatting

### Page Layout Architecture

**Two Format Modes**:

1. **Pages Format** (Traditional):
   - Discrete page boundaries with pagination
   - Page numbers, headers, footers enabled
   - Defined margins and page breaks
   - Standard paper sizes (Letter, Legal, A4, etc.)

2. **Pageless Format** (Modern):
   - Continuous vertical scrolling without page breaks
   - No page numbers or headers/footers
   - Content extends indefinitely
   - Better for web-first documents

### Page Setup Features

**Customization Options**:
- Paper size selection (Letter, Legal, A4, custom dimensions)
- Custom margin configuration (top, bottom, left, right)
- Section breaks for different layouts within same document
- Orientation (portrait/landscape)

**Section Management**:
- **Continuous section breaks**: Change formatting mid-page
- **Next page breaks**: Start new section on next page
- Different headers/footers per section
- Independent page numbering per section
- Varied margins per section

### Technical Rendering Architecture

**Major Architectural Shift (2021)**:
Google Docs migrated from DOM-based rendering to Canvas-based rendering.

**Previous DOM Approach**:
- Heavy JavaScript manipulation of DOM elements
- Each text node, paragraph, and element represented in HTML
- Performance limitations with large documents
- Difficult to achieve precise rendering consistency across platforms

**Current Canvas Approach**:
- Document painted directly to HTML5 Canvas element
- Bypasses DOM manipulation for content rendering
- One canvas element per page in the DOM
- Text removed from DOM tree (rendered as graphics)

**Benefits of Canvas Rendering**:
1. **Performance**: Faster rendering of complex documents
2. **Consistency**: Identical appearance across browsers/platforms
3. **Precision**: Exact pixel-level control over layout
4. **Optimization**: Efficient incremental updates

**Accessibility Considerations**:
- **Annotated Canvas Mode**: Provides DOM annotations inside canvas elements for positional computations
- Screen readers, braille devices, and magnification tools remain compatible
- Chrome extensions requiring DOM access may be affected
- Assistive technologies supported through alternative APIs

**Implementation Philosophy**:
> "Word processors have extremely specific requirements for layout, rendering, and incremental updates." - Original Google Docs engineer

Before resorting to canvas, best practice is to start with virtualizing the DOM so only visible parts render, then move to canvas if frame rate is insufficient.

## Web-Based Document Editor Implementation Patterns

### Core Layout Technologies

**Modern CSS Layout Methods**:

1. **CSS Grid Layout**:
   - Two-dimensional layout system
   - Organize content into rows and columns
   - Excellent for page-based layouts with fixed dimensions

2. **Flexbox**:
   - One-dimensional layout (row or column)
   - Predictable element behavior across screen sizes
   - Ideal for responsive document containers

3. **Absolute Positioning**:
   - Precise control over element placement
   - Used for page numbers, headers, footers
   - Efficient for overlaying elements (watermarks, backgrounds)

### Document Structure Patterns

**Building Block Approach**:
- `<div>` tags as containers for text, images, and page elements
- Absolute or relative positioning based on requirements
- Floats, paddings, and margins for layout control

**Page Container Pattern**:
```css
.page {
  width: 8.5in;
  height: 11in;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background: white;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

**Gap Pattern** (for visual page separation):
```css
.page-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 2rem; /* Visible space between pages */
}
```

### Virtual Scrolling / Windowing

**Performance Optimization**:
For large documents (50+ pages), render only visible pages:

**Technique**:
- Calculate viewport boundaries
- Render pages within visible range ± buffer
- Unmount off-screen pages from DOM
- Maintain scroll position virtually

**Example Logic**:
```javascript
const visiblePageRange = calculateVisiblePages(scrollPosition);
const pagesToRender = pages.slice(
  visiblePageRange.start,
  visiblePageRange.end
);
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced DOM nodes
- Faster initial render
- Lower memory usage
- Smooth scrolling even with hundreds of pages

### Responsive Design Considerations

**Media Queries**:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .page {
    width: 100%;
    transform: scale(0.7);
  }
}
```

**Adaptive Layout**:
- Desktop: Fixed page dimensions with zoom controls
- Tablet: Scaled pages or reflowable content
- Mobile: Often switch to continuous/pageless mode

## Best Practices for Web-Based Page Formatting

### From Research Synthesis

1. **Layout Architecture**:
   - Use layered approach: page backgrounds + content layer
   - Z-index stacking for proper element ordering
   - CSS Grid or Flexbox for page container management

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement virtual scrolling for 50+ pages
   - Use CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
   - Absolute positioning for non-flowing elements (page numbers, headers)

3. **Page Break Logic**:
   - Calculate dynamically based on content height
   - Prevent orphan/widow content (keep related elements together)
   - Use Web Workers for non-blocking calculation

4. **Responsive Strategy**:
   - Fixed dimensions on desktop (e.g., 8.5" x 11")
   - Scaled or reflowed layout on mobile
   - Consider pageless mode for small screens

5. **Accessibility**:
   - Maintain semantic HTML structure when possible
   - If using Canvas, provide DOM annotations
   - Support screen readers and assistive technologies
   - Keyboard navigation for page controls

6. **Typography**:
   - Web fonts with proper fallbacks
   - Fixed line-height for consistent page calculations
   - Monospace fonts for screenplay/code editors
