## Detailed Framework Comparison

### 1. TipTap Editor

#### Overview
- **Built on**: ProseMirror (wrapper/abstraction layer)
- **Philosophy**: Feature-rich without being overly opinionated
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent - "the most well-rounded choice" (2025 comparison)
- **Maturity**: Production-ready, widely used

#### Collaboration Support ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Native Y.js Integration**:
```typescript
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import Collaboration from '@tiptap/extension-collaboration'
import * as Y from 'yjs'
import { HocuspocusProvider } from '@hocuspocus/provider'

const ydoc = new Y.Doc()
const provider = new HocuspocusProvider({
  url: 'ws://127.0.0.1:1234',
  name: 'example-document',
  document: ydoc,
})

const editor = new Editor({
  extensions: [
    Collaboration.configure({
      document: ydoc,
    }),
  ],
})
```

**Hocuspocus Backend** (Open Source):
> "Hocuspocus handles the syncing, authorization, persistence and scaling for collaborative editing"

**Features**:
- Real-time CRDT-based conflict resolution
- Offline editing with automatic merge when reconnected
- WebSocket provider (recommended), WebRTC, or IndexedDB persistence
- Awareness (cursor positions, user presence)
- Self-hosted or TipTap Collab cloud service

**Benefits**:
- **Fully compatible with WritersRoom's Y.js setup** - same underlying technology
- Battle-tested in production (used by many companies)
- Excellent documentation and support

#### Pagination Support ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Official Solution: TipTap Pages (PRO Extension)**

**Features**:
```typescript
import { PageKit } from '@tiptap/extension-page-kit'

const editor = new Editor({
  extensions: [
    PageKit.configure({
      pageFormat: {
        width: 816,  // 8.5 inches at 96 DPI
        height: 1056, // 11 inches at 96 DPI
        margins: {
          top: 96,    // 1 inch
          right: 96,
          bottom: 96,
          left: 144,  // 1.5 inches
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

**Capabilities**:
- **Fixed-height pages** with configurable dimensions
- **Page gaps** for visual separation
- **Headers and footers** per page
- **Table splitting** across pages (heavily modified Table extension)
- **DOCX import/export** with page preservation
- **Custom page formats** (A4, Letter, Legal, custom)
- **Print-ready output** from the editor

**Architecture**:
> "The Pages extension... works by baking pages directly into the document model as nodes in the document tree"

**Key Difference from DIY Solutions**:
- Pages are part of the ProseMirror schema (not CSS tricks)
- Content automatically reflows when pages are full
- Tables intelligently split across page boundaries
- Maintains editing capabilities within paginated view

**Cost**: Part of TipTap Pro ($150-500/year depending on team size)

#### Community Pagination Extensions (Free Alternatives)

**1. tiptap-pagination-breaks** (npm):
```typescript
import PaginationBreaks from 'tiptap-pagination-breaks'

const editor = new Editor({
  extensions: [
    PaginationBreaks.configure({
      pageHeight: 1056,  // 11 inches
      pageWidth: 816,    // 8.5 inches
      pageMargin: 96,    // 1 inch
    }),
  ],
})
```

**Limitations**:
- Less mature than official Pages extension
- May not handle table splitting
- Community support only

**2. tiptap-extension-pagination** (GitHub: hugs7/tiptap-extension-pagination):
- Basic pagination support
- Configurable paper size, color, orientation
- Free and open source

**Developer Consensus**:
> "Pagination in TipTap is considered one of the most difficult programming tasks... the ultimate solution needs to be based in the ProseMirror schema with pages as nodes"

**Result**: The official Pages extension solves this properly, community extensions are workarounds.

#### Migration Path from Slate

**Similarities**:
- Both use declarative React components
- Both have plugin/extension systems
- Both support custom node types
- Both have Y.js collaboration bindings

**Key Differences**:
```typescript
// Slate approach (what you have now)
const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue)

<Slate editor={editor} initialValue={value} onChange={setValue}>
  <Editable renderElement={renderElement} renderLeaf={renderLeaf} />
</Slate>

// TipTap approach
const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [Document, Paragraph, Text, Character, Dialogue],
  content: initialValue,
  onUpdate: ({ editor }) => {
    const json = editor.getJSON()
    // Handle changes
  },
})

<EditorContent editor={editor} />
```

**Migration Complexity**: **Medium** (4-8 weeks)
- Convert Slate document schema to TipTap/ProseMirror schema
- Reimplement custom screenplay node types as TipTap extensions
- Migrate Y.js integration (straightforward - same provider pattern)
- Update autosave logic to work with TipTap's API
- Re-style elements for screenplay formatting
- Test collaboration and real-time sync
- Migrate existing documents

**Advantages**:
- Get official pagination solution (Pages PRO)
- Better documentation and ecosystem
- More active development and community
- Built on battle-tested ProseMirror foundation

**Disadvantages**:
- Migration effort (4-8 weeks)
- PRO license cost ($150-500/year)
- Learning curve for ProseMirror concepts
- Need to reimplement custom screenplay formatting

import { ySyncPlugin, yCursorPlugin, yUndoPlugin } from 'y-prosemirror'
import * as Y from 'yjs'
import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket'

const ydoc = new Y.Doc()
const provider = new WebsocketProvider('ws://localhost:1234', 'prosemirror', ydoc)
const type = ydoc.getXmlFragment('prosemirror')

const editor = new EditorView({
  state: EditorState.create({
    schema,
    plugins: [
      ySyncPlugin(type),
      yCursorPlugin(provider.awareness),
      yUndoPlugin(),
      keymap({
        'Mod-z': undo,
        'Mod-y': redo,
        'Mod-Shift-z': redo,
      }),
    ],
  }),
})
```

- Awareness plugin for cursors and presence
- Custom undo/redo with Y.js integration
- Conflict-free merging

**Benefits**:
- Direct control over collaboration behavior
- Can optimize for specific use cases
- Same Y.js technology as WritersRoom currently uses

#### Pagination Support ⭐⭐⭐ (DIY Required)

**No Official Solution** - Must implement custom

**Community Approaches**:

**Approach 1: Pages as Schema Nodes**
```typescript
const schema = new Schema({
  nodes: {
    doc: { content: "page+" },
    page: {
      content: "block+",
      attrs: { pageNumber: { default: 1 } },
      parseDOM: [{ tag: "div.page" }],
      toDOM: (node) => ["div", { class: "page" }, 0],
    },
    paragraph: { content: "inline*" },
    // ... other nodes
  },
})
```

**Approach 2: Decorations + CSS**
```typescript
// Similar to Slate's current approach
function pageDecorations(state) {
  const decorations = []
  let height = 0
  const PAGE_HEIGHT = 1056 // 11 inches

  state.doc.descendants((node, pos) => {
    const domNode = view.nodeDOM(pos)
    const nodeHeight = domNode.getBoundingClientRect().height

    if (height + nodeHeight > PAGE_HEIGHT) {
      decorations.push(
        Decoration.widget(pos, createPageBreak)
      )
      height = nodeHeight
    } else {
      height += nodeHeight
    }
  })

  return DecorationSet.create(state.doc, decorations)
}
```

**Approach 3: Split Transform**
```typescript
// Split document into pages using transforms
function paginateDocument(tr) {
  // Walk document, calculate heights
  // Use tr.split() to create new pages
  // Redistribute content across pages
}
```

**Community Implementations**:
- **Badon Writer**: Open source project with 300+ page support
- Multiple forum discussions with different approaches
- No consensus on "best" solution

**Challenges**:
> "For pagination that needs to be accurate immediately with diverse fonts, implementations must rely on the browser's ability to measure element sizes, requiring significant 'shadow' rendering"

> "ProseMirror can struggle to keep up with the workload for long documents where in-editor pagination is particularly valuable"

**Result**: **Possible but requires significant custom implementation** (similar complexity to Slate)

#### Migration Path from Slate

**Migration Complexity**: **High** (8-12 weeks)
- ProseMirror is lower-level than Slate
- Must understand ProseMirror's document model, transforms, and state management
- Reimplement all screenplay formatting as ProseMirror plugins
- Build custom React components/wrappers
- Handle Y.js integration manually
- Implement pagination from scratch (no official solution)

**When to Choose**:
- Need maximum control over editor behavior
- Have ProseMirror expertise in-house
- Want to build proprietary pagination solution
- Don't want vendor lock-in (TipTap PRO)

**When NOT to Choose**:
- Timeline constraints (< 12 weeks)
- Budget for TipTap PRO is available
- Team lacks ProseMirror experience

```typescript
import { LexicalComposer } from '@lexical/react/LexicalComposer'
import { CollaborationPlugin } from '@lexical/react/LexicalCollaborationPlugin'
import * as Y from 'yjs'
import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket'

const ydoc = new Y.Doc()
const provider = new WebsocketProvider('ws://localhost:1234', 'lexical-doc', ydoc)

<LexicalComposer initialConfig={config}>
  <CollaborationPlugin
    id="lexical-collab"
    provider Provider={provider}
    shouldBootstrap={true}
  />
</LexicalComposer>
```

**Liveblocks Integration** (Alternative):
```typescript
import { LiveblocksPlugin } from '@liveblocks/react-lexical'

<LexicalComposer>
  <LiveblocksPlugin />
</LexicalComposer>
```

**Features**:
- Y.js CRDT support via community plugins
- Liveblocks native integration
- Real-time cursor tracking
- Offline-first support

**Maturity**: Less mature than ProseMirror/TipTap Y.js bindings

#### Pagination Support ⭐⭐ (Limited)

**No Official Solution**

**Community Discussions**:
> "Users have explored implementing pages in the editor, similar to Microsoft Word or Google Docs where each page has a blank space between them. However, developers have used CSS pagination solutions as a workaround, as pagination isn't a built-in native feature"

**Current Status**:
- CSS-based workarounds only
- No schema-based pagination solution
- Community still exploring approaches
- Not production-ready for page-based editing

**Developer Feedback**:
> "One developer reported trying many JS text editors like Slate and Lexical for pagination with no success"

#### Migration Path from Slate

**Migration Complexity**: **High** (8-12 weeks)
- Completely different architecture from Slate
- Must learn Lexical's node system and commands
- Pagination not solved - would need custom implementation
- Y.js integration less mature than alternatives

**When to Choose**:
- Want cutting-edge editor technology
- Pagination not a requirement (or willing to build custom)
- Need extremely lightweight core
- Want React-first modern architecture

**When NOT to Choose**:
- **Pagination is a core requirement** (not well-supported)
- Need stable, battle-tested collaboration
- Timeline constraints

### 4. Slate (Current)

#### Overview
- **What WritersRoom Uses Now**
- **Philosophy**: Highly customizable framework for building editors
- **Maturity**: Still in beta, API changes possible
- **Android Support**: Experimental

#### Collaboration Support ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Y.js Integration** (slate-yjs):
```typescript
// What WritersRoom currently has
import { withYjs, YjsEditor } from 'slate-yjs'
import * as Y from 'yjs'
import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket'

const ydoc = new Y.Doc()
const provider = new WebsocketProvider('ws://localhost:8000', 'script-123', ydoc)
const sharedType = ydoc.getArray('content')

const editor = withYjs(withReact(createEditor()), sharedType)
```

**Current WritersRoom Implementation**:
- Working Y.js collaboration with WebSocket provider
- Redis pub/sub for multi-server coordination
- Autosave with optimistic concurrency control
- Awareness for cursor positions

**Status**: **Working well** - no issues with current collaboration setup

#### Pagination Support ⭐⭐ (DIY Required)

**Community Implementations**:
- **slate-paged** (tobischw): "A buggy attempt at paginating the Slate editor"
  - Issues: memory consumption (>10 pages), overflow problems
  - No block splitting - entire blocks move to next page
- **slate-paged** (usunil0): Experimental, basic approach

**Current WritersRoom Approach**:
- Decoration-based with 55-line counting
- Visual separators between pages
- No fixed-height enforcement yet

**Challenges**:
> "Pagination in Slate is challenging and not officially supported, requiring custom solutions that balance performance with accuracy"

**Proposed Solution**: Height-based pagination with DOM measurement (as detailed in previous research)

#### Migration Path

**To TipTap**: Medium complexity (4-8 weeks)
**To ProseMirror**: High complexity (8-12 weeks)
**To Lexical**: High complexity (8-12 weeks), pagination unsolved

## Technical Deep Dives

### TipTap Pages Architecture

**How It Works**:
```typescript
// Pages are nodes in the schema
const pagesSchema = {
  nodes: {
    doc: { content: "page+" },
    page: {
      content: "block+",
      attrs: {
        pageNumber: { default: 1 },
        width: { default: 816 },
        height: { default: 1056 },
        margins: { default: { top: 96, right: 96, bottom: 96, left: 144 } },
      },
    },
    // ... other nodes
  },
}
```

**Content Reflow**:
- ProseMirror transforms automatically redistribute content
- When page is full, new page node created
- Content moved to new page via `tr.split()`
- Tables split intelligently at row boundaries

**Performance**:
- Optimized for 300+ page documents (Badon Writer example)
- Incremental rendering (only visible pages rendered)
- Shadow DOM measurement for height calculations
- Cached measurements for performance

### Y.js Compatibility

**All Options Compatible**:
- TipTap: `@tiptap/extension-collaboration` (y-prosemirror wrapper)
- ProseMirror: `y-prosemirror` directly
- Lexical: Community Y.js bindings
- Slate: `slate-yjs` (current)

**WebSocket Provider** (what WritersRoom uses):
- Same provider works across all frameworks
- Just connect different editor binding
- Backend (Redis pub/sub) remains unchanged

**Migration Impact**:
- Frontend editor changes
- Backend WebSocket handling stays same
- Document sync protocol unchanged (Y.js binary protocol)

---

## Cost Analysis

### TipTap PRO Licensing

**Pricing Tiers** (2025):
- **Solo**: ~$150/year (1 developer)
- **Team**: ~$300/year (up to 5 developers)
- **Enterprise**: ~$500/year (unlimited, priority support)

**What's Included**:
- Pages extension (pagination)
- TableKit (table splitting across pages)
- DOCX import/export
- Advanced extensions
- Priority support

**ROI Calculation**:
```
Custom Pagination Development: 6-8 weeks @ $10,000/week = $60,000-$80,000
TipTap PRO License: $300/year
Migration Effort: 4-8 weeks @ $10,000/week = $40,000-$80,000

Total Cost:
- TipTap Route: $40,300-$80,300 (one-time migration + annual license)
- Custom Route: $60,000-$80,000 (one-time) + ongoing maintenance

Break-even: If custom pagination takes 6+ weeks OR requires 40+ hours/year maintenance,
TipTap is more cost-effective
```

### Slate Height-Based Pagination

**Development Cost**:
- 3-4 weeks implementation: $30,000-$40,000
- Ongoing maintenance: ~20 hours/year = $2,000/year

**Trade-offs**:
- Lower upfront cost
- 95-98% consistency (vs 100%)
- No vendor dependency
- More code to maintain
