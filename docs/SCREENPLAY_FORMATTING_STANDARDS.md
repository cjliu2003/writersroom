## 2. Screenplay Element Types and Formatting

### 2.1 Scene Heading (Slug Line)

**Purpose**: Introduces a new scene by establishing location and time

**Format**:
- Always in ALL CAPS
- Left margin: 1.5 inches from page edge (flush with left margin)
- Structure: `INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME OF DAY`

**Examples**:
```

```

**Components**:
- **INT./EXT.**: Interior or Exterior location
- **LOCATION**: Specific place where scene occurs

**Spacing**:
- Double-spaced before and after (except when starting a new page)

---

### 2.2 Action (Scene Description)

**Purpose**: Describes what can be seen or heard in the scene

**Format**:
- Left margin: 1.5 inches from page edge
- Right margin: 1 inch from page edge
- Written in present tense
- Single-spaced within paragraphs
- Double-spaced between paragraphs

**Guidelines**:
- Describe only what can be SEEN or HEARD (never internal thoughts unless vocalized)
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 lines maximum for readability)
- Use active voice and present tense
- Introduce characters in ALL CAPS on first appearance
- Keep description concise and visual

**Example**:
```
The rain pounds against the window. SARAH (30s, determined)
enters the room, dripping wet. She tosses her keys on the
counter.

A clock on the wall reads 3:47 AM.
```

---

### 2.3 Character Name (Character Cue)

**Purpose**: Indicates which character is speaking

**Format**:
- Position: 3.7 inches from left page edge (2.2 inches from left margin)
- Always in ALL CAPS
- Single-spaced above dialogue

**Special Notations**:

SARAH

JOHN (V.O.)

DETECTIVE MILLER (O.S.)

SARAH (CONT'D)
```

---

### 2.4 Dialogue

**Purpose**: The spoken words of a character

**Format**:
- Position: 2.5 inches from left page edge (1 inch from left margin)
- Right margin: Approximately 2.5 inches from right page edge
- Single-spaced
- One line break before and after

**Guidelines**:

                    SARAH
          I can't believe you did this. After
          everything we've been through, you
          just threw it all away.
```

---

### 2.5 Parenthetical (Wryly)

**Purpose**: Provides brief direction about how dialogue is delivered or character action during dialogue

**Format**:
- Position: 3.0-3.1 inches from left page edge (1.5-1.6 inches from left margin)
- Enclosed in parentheses
- One short line only

**Guidelines**:
- Use sparingly (only when essential for clarity)
- Keep brief (3-4 words maximum)
- Describe delivery, not general action
- Common uses: (beat), (pause), (to John), (whispers), (angry), (sarcastic)

**Example**:
```
                    SARAH
                      (whispering)
          He's right behind you.

                    JOHN
          What?
                      (realizing)
          Oh no.
```

### 2.6 Transition

**Purpose**: Indicates how one scene transitions to the next

**Format**:
- Right-aligned
- Position: 6.0 inches from left page edge

- **CUT TO:**
- **DISSOLVE TO:**
- **FADE TO BLACK**
- **SMASH CUT TO:**
- **MATCH CUT TO:**

**Guidelines**:

- **FADE OUT.** is the final line of every screenplay (right-aligned)

**Example**:
```
                                                CUT TO:
```

---

### 2.7 Shot (Camera Direction)

**Purpose**: Specifies specific camera angles or movements

**Format**:

- ALL CAPS
- Used sparingly in spec scripts

**Common Shots**:
- CLOSE UP ON
- EXTREME CLOSE UP
- POV (Point of View)
- ANGLE ON
- INSERT
- PAN TO
- TRACK WITH

**Guidelines**:
- Avoid excessive camera direction in spec scripts (director's domain)
- Use only when critical to story understanding
- Directors and cinematographers typically determine shot composition

---

## 3. Smart Page Break Rules

Smart page breaks are crucial for professional screenplay formatting. These rules prevent awkward page breaks that interrupt the reading flow and ensure the script maintains professional standards.

### 3.1 Scene Heading Rules

**RULE**: Scene headings should NEVER be left alone at the bottom of a page.

**Implementation**:
- If a scene heading would appear as the last line of a page, move it to the top of the next page
- Ensure at least 1-2 lines of action follow the scene heading on the same page

**Exception**:
- Establishing shot scene headings that stand alone (no accompanying action) may remain at bottom of page

**Example of INCORRECT formatting**:
```
[Page 23, bottom]
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

[Page 24, top]
Detective Miller reviews the case files.
```

**Example of CORRECT formatting**:
```
[Page 23, bottom]
She walks out the door.

[Page 24, top]
INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Detective Miller reviews the case files.
```

---

### 3.2 Character Name (Orphan) Rules

**RULE**: Character names should NEVER be left orphaned at the bottom of a page without their dialogue.

**Implementation**:
- If a character name appears as the last line of a page, move it to the top of the next page with its dialogue
- Never separate character name from dialogue

**Example of INCORRECT formatting**:
```
[Page 45, bottom]
                    SARAH

[Page 46, top]
          I can't believe this is happening.
```

**Example of CORRECT formatting**:
```
[Page 45, bottom]
She closes the door behind her.

[Page 46, top]
                    SARAH
          I can't believe this is happening.
```

---

### 3.3 Dialogue Continuity Rules

**RULE**: When dialogue must span across pages, follow strict continuation protocols.

**Requirements**:
1. Break only after at least 2 lines of dialogue have appeared on the first page
2. Break only at the end of a complete sentence
3. Add (MORE) indicator at bottom of page (indented as character name)
4. Add (CONT'D) after character name on continuation page

**Example**:
```
[Page 67, bottom]
                    DETECTIVE MILLER
          Listen to me very carefully. The
          evidence we've collected points to
          one inevitable conclusion. The
          suspect was in the building.
                                (MORE)

[Page 68, top]
                    DETECTIVE MILLER (CONT'D)
          But we need your testimony to prove
          it beyond a reasonable doubt.
```

**Additional Guidelines**:
- Avoid dialogue splits whenever possible
- If dialogue can fit on one page with minor rewording, rewrite to eliminate break
- Never break dialogue mid-sentence across pages

---

### 3.4 Parenthetical Rules

**RULE**: Parentheticals should not be left at the bottom of a page separated from their dialogue.

**Implementation**:
- If a parenthetical would be the last element on a page, move it with its dialogue to the next page
- You CAN put a page break BEFORE the parenthetical if necessary
- You CANNOT put a page break AFTER the parenthetical

**Example of INCORRECT formatting**:
```
[Page 32, bottom]
                    JOHN
                      (whispering)

[Page 33, top]
          He's coming this way.
```

**Example of CORRECT formatting**:
```
[Page 32, bottom]
She looks around nervously.

[Page 33, top]
                    JOHN
                      (whispering)
          He's coming this way.
```

---

### 3.5 Transition Rules

**RULE**: Transitions should appear at the BOTTOM of a page, never at the top.

**Implementation**:
- If a transition would appear as the first line of a new page, move it to the bottom of the previous page
- This preserves the visual flow and reading rhythm

**Example of INCORRECT formatting**:
```
[Page 89, bottom]
He walks into the darkness.

[Page 90, top]
                                        CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
```

**Example of CORRECT formatting**:
```
[Page 89, bottom]
He walks into the darkness.
                                        CUT TO:

[Page 90, top]
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
```

---

### 3.6 Automatic Smart Page Breaking

**Professional Software Implementation**:

Modern screenwriting software like Final Draft, Celtx, WriterDuet, and Highland automatically handle smart page breaks by:

1. Detecting orphaned elements (scene headings, character names)
2. Calculating available space on current page
3. Forcing page breaks at appropriate locations
4. Automatically inserting (MORE) and (CONT'D) indicators
5. Preventing mid-sentence dialogue breaks
6. Maintaining proper spacing and margins across page boundaries

**Manual Screenplay Formatting**:
If formatting manually (not recommended), the writer must:
- Review every page break individually
- Apply all smart page break rules manually
- Insert continuation indicators where needed
- Adjust spacing to prevent orphaned elements

## 4. Element Positioning Reference Table

| Element | Left Position (from page edge) | Left Position (from margin) | Right Position |
|---------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| Scene Heading | 1.5" | 0" (flush) | 1" from right edge |
| Action | 1.5" | 0" (flush) | 1" from right edge |
| Character Name | 3.7" | 2.2" | — |
| Parenthetical | 3.0-3.1" | 1.5-1.6" | — |
| Dialogue | 2.5" | 1.0" | ~2.5" from right edge |
| Transition | 6.0" | 4.5" | Right-aligned |

**Note**: "FADE IN:" (opening only) is positioned at 1.5" from left edge (flush with left margin)

---

## 5. Additional Formatting Elements

### 5.1 Dual Dialogue

**Purpose**: Show two characters speaking simultaneously

**Format**:
- Both character names and dialogue appear side-by-side on the same page
- Each dialogue column narrower than standard
- Used sparingly (only when simultaneous speech is critical)

**Software Support**: Most professional screenwriting software supports dual dialogue formatting

---

### 5.2 Montage

**Purpose**: Show a series of short scenes in rapid succession

**Format**:
```
MONTAGE - SARAH'S TRAINING

- Sarah practices at shooting range
- Sarah studies case files late at night
- Sarah spars in the gym

END MONTAGE
```

---

### 5.3 Intercut

**Purpose**: Show alternating action between two locations

**Format**:
```
INTERCUT - PHONE CONVERSATION

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

SARAH
Did you find anything?

INT. JOHN'S CAR - NIGHT

JOHN
Not yet, but I'm getting close.

## 7. Industry Best Practices

### 7.1 General Writing Guidelines

1. **Brevity**: Keep scene descriptions concise (3-4 lines max per paragraph)
2. **Clarity**: Write only what can be filmed (avoid internal thoughts)
3. **Pacing**: Use white space effectively for visual breathing room
4. **Consistency**: Maintain character name spelling and formatting throughout
5. **Simplicity**: Avoid technical jargon unless essential to story
6. **Present Tense**: Always write action in present tense
7. **Active Voice**: Use active verbs for dynamic, engaging action

### 7.2 Common Formatting Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't**:
- Use fancy fonts or multiple font sizes
- Include camera directions in spec scripts (director's job)
- Write page numbers manually (software handles this)
- Use colored text or highlighting
- Include production information in spec script (budget, locations, etc.)
- Add scene numbers (only used in production drafts)
- Over-use parentheticals (trust actors and directors)
- Write directing in action lines ("we see," "camera pans to")
- Include unnecessary transitions (implied CUT TO between scenes)

✅ **Do**:
- Let professional software handle formatting
- Trust the "one page = one minute" rule
- Keep action visual and filmable
- Write character voices distinctly
- Use white space for visual pacing
- Follow smart page break rules consistently
- Proofread for typos and formatting errors

### 7.3 Spec Script vs. Production Draft

**Spec Script** (For Sale/Consideration):
- Minimal camera directions
- No scene numbers
- Focus on story and character
- Clean, readable format
- Limited technical directions

**Production Draft** (Shooting Script):
- Scene numbers
- More detailed camera directions
- Revision colors (blue, pink, yellow, green, etc.)
- Locked pages
- Production annotations

---

## 8. The "One Page = One Minute" Rule

### 8.1 Why This Matters

The industry-standard formatting ensures that:
- **1 page of properly formatted screenplay ≈ 1 minute of screen time**

This rule enables:
- Quick script assessment by producers and agents
- Accurate runtime estimation before production
- Budget and scheduling calculations
- Pacing analysis during development

### 8.2 How Formatting Achieves This

The precise combination of:
- Courier 12pt font (fixed-width characters)
- Specific margin specifications
- Standard element positioning
- White space conventions
- ~55 lines per page

Creates a consistent "page density" that correlates reliably to screen time.

### 8.3 Variations

**Faster-paced scripts** (action, thriller):
- More white space
- Shorter paragraphs
- Brief dialogue
- May result in 90-page script = 110-minute film

**Dialogue-heavy scripts** (drama, comedy):
- Dense dialogue blocks
- Longer conversations
- May result in 110-page script = 100-minute film

**Average**: 100-120 pages for feature film (90-120 minutes)

---

## 9. Summary and Key Takeaways

### Essential Requirements

1. **Font**: Courier 12pt (monospaced, 10 char/inch, 6 lines/inch)
2. **Margins**: 1.5" left, 1" top/bottom/right
3. **Elements**: Scene Heading, Action, Character, Dialogue, Parenthetical, Transition
4. **Smart Page Breaks**: Never orphan scene headings, character names, or parentheticals
5. **Dialogue Continuity**: Use (MORE) and (CONT'D) when breaking across pages
6. **Software**: Use professional screenwriting software (Final Draft, Celtx, WriterDuet, etc.)

### Professional Standards

- Industry professionals expect perfect formatting
- Improper formatting signals amateur status
- Formatting should be "invisible" to the reader
- Story and character are paramount; formatting supports them
- Modern software eliminates formatting concerns for writers

### The Bottom Line

**Proper screenplay formatting is non-negotiable in the film and television industry.** Using professional screenwriting software that automatically applies these standards is essential for any serious screenwriter. The formatting rules exist to create consistency, readability, and the reliable "one page = one minute" conversion that the entire industry depends on for script evaluation, production planning, and budgeting.
