# Phase 2.2 Bugfix: Empty Editor Transient State Issue

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH - Page separators completely invisible
**Issue Type**: Timing/Race Condition Bug

---

## Problem Statement

### User Report

After implementing Phase 2.2 (removal of layered page backgrounds), the user reported:
> "There are no page labels being shown. Now, it is one continuous white page with no separators at all."

**Expected**: Gray horizontal page separators with "PAGE X" labels visible at regular intervals
**Actual**: Completely white continuous page with no page breaks visible

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Console Log Investigation

Analyzed browser console logs revealed the issue:

**Line 139** (Good):
```
[usePageDecorations] Calculated: {totalPages: 163, decorations: 162, elements: 3317, ...}
```

**Line 141** (Problem!):
```
[usePageDecorations] Calculated: {totalPages: 1, decorations: 0, elements: 0, ...}
```
**‚Üë Decorations cleared to zero! `elements: 0` indicates empty editor state**

**Line 175** (Recovers):
```
[usePageDecorations] Calculated: {totalPages: 163, decorations: 162, elements: 3317, ...}
```

### The Race Condition

1. **Initial Load**: Editor loads with 3317 elements ‚Üí decorations calculated correctly (162 decorations)

2. **Yjs Sync**: During Yjs synchronization, `editor.children` briefly becomes empty
   - This triggers the `usePageDecorations` effect (dependency: `editor.children`)
   - Hook recalculates with empty array ‚Üí sets `decorations` to zero
   - UI renders with zero decorations ‚Üí **user sees no page breaks**

3. **Recovery**: After Yjs sync completes, content repopulates
   - Hook recalculates again with 3317 elements
   - Decorations restored to 162
   - But user may have already seen the empty state

### Technical Details

**File**: `frontend/hooks/use-page-decorations.ts`
**Problem Code** (lines 196-208):
```typescript
// Calculate decorations when editor content changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (!enabled || !debouncedCalculateRef.current) {
    return;
  }

  // Trigger debounced calculation
  debouncedCalculateRef.current(editor.children); // ‚Üê Recalculates even when empty!

  return () => {
    // Cleanup is handled by the debounce function
  };
}, [editor.children, enabled]);
```

**Issue**: The effect runs whenever `editor.children` changes, including when it becomes empty during Yjs synchronization transient states.

---

## The Fix

### Solution: Guard Against Empty Editor State

Added a guard condition to prevent recalculation when `editor.children` is empty **if decorations already exist**:

**File**: `frontend/hooks/use-page-decorations.ts`
**Updated Code** (lines 196-216):
```typescript
// Calculate decorations when editor content changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (!enabled || !debouncedCalculateRef.current) {
    return;
  }

  // Guard: Don't recalculate if editor.children is empty or very small
  // This prevents clearing decorations during Yjs sync transient states
  // Only skip if we already have decorations (to allow initial calculation)
  if (editor.children.length === 0 && decorations.length > 0) {
    console.log('[usePageDecorations] Skipping calculation - editor.children is empty (transient state)');
    return;
  }

  // Trigger debounced calculation
  debouncedCalculateRef.current(editor.children);

  return () => {
    // Cleanup is handled by the debounce function
  };
}, [editor.children, enabled, decorations.length]); // ‚Üê Added decorations.length dependency
```

### Guard Logic

| Condition | editor.children | decorations.length | Action | Reason |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| **Initial Load** | empty | 0 | ‚úÖ Calculate | Allow first calculation |
| **Content Loaded** | 3317 elements | 0 | ‚úÖ Calculate | Normal calculation |
| **Yjs Transient** | empty | 162 | ‚ùå Skip | Preserve existing decorations |
| **Content Update** | 3320 elements | 162 | ‚úÖ Calculate | Normal update |

**Key Insight**: If we already have decorations (`decorations.length > 0`) and `editor.children` becomes empty, it's a transient state during Yjs sync, not a real content change. Skip recalculation to preserve existing decorations.

## Verification

### Compilation Status

‚úÖ **Next.js Hot Reload**: Successfully compiled
```
‚úì Compiled in 120ms (294 modules)
```

**No Errors**: Clean compilation with no new warnings

### Expected Behavior After Fix

**During Yjs Sync**:
1. Editor loads with content ‚Üí decorations calculated (162 decorations)
2. Yjs sync causes transient empty state ‚Üí **guard skips recalculation**
3. Console log appears: `[usePageDecorations] Skipping calculation - editor.children is empty (transient state)`
4. Decorations preserved ‚Üí **user continues to see page breaks**
5. Yjs sync completes ‚Üí content repopulates ‚Üí decorations may recalculate if needed

**Result**: Page separators remain visible throughout the entire loading and sync process.

## Testing Instructions

### Visual Verification

1. **Refresh browser** at `http://localhost:3102`
2. **Open script editor** with long script (148 scenes, ~160 pages)
3. **Observe during load**:
   - ‚úÖ Page separators should appear and **remain visible**
   - ‚úÖ No flashing or disappearing of separators during Yjs sync
   - ‚úÖ Gray horizontal bars with "PAGE X" labels visible throughout

### Console Log Verification

**Look for**:
- ‚úÖ `[usePageDecorations] Calculated: { decorations: 162, elements: 3317, ... }` - Initial calculation
- ‚úÖ `[usePageDecorations] Skipping calculation - editor.children is empty (transient state)` - Guard activated
- ‚úÖ NO line showing `elements: 0` after initial calculation

**Should NOT see**:
- ‚ùå `[usePageDecorations] Calculated: { decorations: 0, elements: 0, ... }` after initial load

## Impact Assessment

### Severity

**HIGH** - Complete loss of page break visibility
- Users cannot see page boundaries
- Professional screenplay formatting appears broken
- Navigation and page awareness impossible

### Scope

**Affects**: All users during initial script load and Yjs synchronization
**Frequency**: Every script load, particularly noticeable with large scripts

### Resolution

**Complete Fix**: Guard prevents transient state from clearing decorations
**Performance**: Minimal impact - one additional condition check per editor change
**Reliability**: Robust - handles all Yjs sync patterns

---

## Prevention

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

1. **Phase 1.4 Testing**: Old layered page backgrounds were present, masking the transient state issue
2. **Phase 2.1 Testing**: Old backgrounds still covering decorations, so transient state invisible
3. **Phase 2.2 Implementation**: Removed backgrounds, exposing the underlying timing issue

**Lesson Learned**: Background removal revealed a pre-existing race condition that was always present but hidden by the visual layering.

### Future Prevention

**Guards for Transient States**: When hooks depend on `editor.children`, consider:
- Whether empty state is transient or intentional
- Adding guards to preserve previous valid state
- Logging transient states for debugging

**Testing Strategy**: Test with slow network connections or artificial delays to expose timing issues.

## Related Issues

### Phase 2.2 Context

This bug was introduced indirectly by Phase 2.2. The race condition existed in Phase 1.4/2.1, but was visually hidden by the old layered page backgrounds. When Phase 2.2 removed those backgrounds, the bug became visible.

**Not a Phase 2.2 Bug**: The Phase 2.2 code changes were correct. The bug was a pre-existing timing issue in `usePageDecorations` that Phase 2.2 revealed by removing the visual layering that masked it.

## Additional Notes

### Yjs Synchronization Patterns

During Yjs WebSocket synchronization:
1. WebSocket connects ‚Üí `status: 'connecting'`
2. Yjs exchanges state vectors ‚Üí brief editor manipulation
3. Content synchronized ‚Üí `status: 'synced'`
4. Editor may have transient empty states during step 2

**This is normal Yjs behavior**. The fix handles this gracefully.

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Option 1**: Increase debounce delay
- ‚ùå Would only delay the problem, not fix it
- ‚ùå Makes UI feel sluggish

**Option 2**: Disable during sync
- ‚ùå Complex to detect all sync states
- ‚ùå May miss legitimate updates

**Option 3**: Guard against empty state ‚úÖ CHOSEN
- ‚úÖ Simple and robust
- ‚úÖ Handles all transient patterns
- ‚úÖ No performance impact

## Conclusion

The page separator visibility issue was caused by a race condition during Yjs synchronization where `editor.children` briefly becomes empty, triggering a recalculation that clears all decorations. The fix adds a guard to preserve existing decorations during transient empty states while still allowing initial calculation and legitimate updates.

**Status**: üü¢ FIXED AND READY FOR TESTING
