**Research Date**: 2025-10-29
**Purpose**: Understanding professional screenplay title page/card design for visual implementation

## Executive Summary

Professional screenplay title pages follow strict industry standards centered around minimalism, proper typography (Courier font family), and precise positioning. The key is a clean, centered layout with the title positioned 1/4 to 1/3 down the page, followed by writer credits and contact information at the bottom.

## Core Design Elements

### 1. Typography Standards

**Font Requirements**:
- **Primary Font**: 12-point Courier (industry standard since 1955)
- **Acceptable Variants**: Courier New, Courier Prime, Courier Final Draft
- **Rationale**: Monospaced font ensures consistency and the "one page = one minute" timing rule
- **Title Exception**: While body text must be Courier, the title itself can use a stylistic font as long as it's legible

**Font Characteristics**:
- Monospaced (every character occupies equal space)
- Fixed-pitch typeface
- Maintains uniformity and readability
- Signals professionalism to industry readers

### 2. Layout & Positioning

**Title Placement**:
- **Vertical Position**: 1/4 to 1/3 down the page (approximately 20-22 line spaces below 1" top margin)
- **Specific Measurement**: Line 25 is often used as the standard starting point
- **Horizontal**: Centered on the page
- **Format**: ALL CAPS for spec scripts
- **Style**: Can be bold for emphasis

**Writing Credits**:
- **Position**: 4 blank lines below the title
- **Text**: "by" or "Written by" (centered)
- **Author Name**: 1 blank line below credit line (centered on approximately line 32)
- **Double-spaced** between title, credit, and name

**Contact Information**:
- **Position**: Bottom left or bottom right corner
- **Contents**: Email address (essential), phone number (optional), address (optional)
- **Minimalist approach**: Only include what's necessary

### 3. Margins

**Industry Standard**:
- **All sides**: 1 inch margins (non-negotiable)
- **Consistency**: Critical for professional appearance and timing calculations

### 4. What to Include

**Essential Elements** (The "Rule of Three"):
1. Title
2. Writing credits (by/written by + author name)
3. Contact information

**What to AVOID** (Professional Standards):
- ❌ Draft dates or numbers (dates the script)
- ❌ Copyright notices (mark of amateur - industry insiders know scripts are automatically copyrighted)
- ❌ WGA registration numbers
- ❌ Loglines or taglines
- ❌ Images or graphics
- ❌ Unique decorative fonts (except possibly for the title)
- ❌ Any unnecessary clutter

### 5. Design Philosophy

**Minimalism is Key**:
- "Less is more" approach
- Clean, uncluttered presentation
- Professional appearance over creativity
- Purpose: Present crucial information clearly

**Professional Standards**:
- Spec scripts require more conservative formatting
- Shooting scripts may have more flexibility
- First impressions matter to producers and readers

                      (ALL CAPS, Centered)

                     [4 blank lines]

                           by

                     [1 blank line]

## Implementation Recommendations

### For Script Preview Cards:

1. **Title Presentation**:
   - Use Courier or Courier-like monospace font
   - Display in ALL CAPS
   - Center both horizontally and vertically within the card
   - Consider larger font size for prominence (while maintaining Courier style)

2. **Author/Writer Credit**:
   - Position below title with appropriate spacing (4 lines in full page, proportional in card)
   - Show "by [Author Name]" or "Written by [Author Name]"
   - Use same Courier font family
   - Slightly smaller than title but still readable

3. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Title: Largest, bold
   - Credit line: Medium size
   - Author name: Same as credit or slightly larger
   - Maintain proportional spacing

4. **Color Scheme**:
   - Traditional: Black text on white/cream background
   - Modern alternatives: Dark gray on light background for softer appearance
   - Maintain high contrast for readability

5. **Card Aesthetics**:
   - Clean white or cream background (simulating paper)
   - Minimal or no borders
   - Generous whitespace around text
   - Professional, understated appearance

### Dynamic Generation from Data:

**Script Name** → Title (ALL CAPS, Courier, centered)
**Profile Name** → Author credit ("by [Name]", Courier, centered below title)

**Spacing Calculation**:
- Title at ~25-30% from top of card
- 3-4 line equivalent spacing
- Author credit positioned proportionally
